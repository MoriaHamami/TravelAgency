## Technologies

A completely responsive travel agency website, created using React & Next.js frameworks, HTML, CSS vanilla and Javascript.  
The API calls to the backend are done using axios, while the data is fetched using PHP and SQL from a MySQL database.
Several third side libraries were used for different goals, such as axios, swiper, form-data and more.

The main features of this website are:

✅ Header with toggle menu effect using vanilla javascript.

✅ Home section with touch slider using swiper.js

✅ About section using flexbox.

✅ Reviews section with touch slider using swiper.js

✅ Packages section using grid.

✅ Booking form section.

✅ Footer section using grid.
